Media Library Pro offers Blade, Vue, and React components to upload files to your application.

Media Library Pro ships with two components for every environment: an attachment component, and a collection component.

The attachment component can upload one or more files with little or no extra information. It's is a lightweight solution for small bits of UI like avatar fields or message attachments.

The collection component can upload multiple files with custom properties. Use the collection component shines when you need to manage media, for example in admin panels.
